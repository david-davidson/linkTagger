linkTagger.sh
=============

This shell script makes link tagging faster&mdash;way faster. It uses sed, the regex-powered stream editor, to add Google link tagging (GLT) to all the links in all the files in whatever directory you want. Just copy the files&mdash;or entire directories&mdash;you&rsquo;d like to tag into your tagging directory, and then run linkTagger.sh from your Linux or Cygwin command line. The script will prompt you for GLT parameters (or preexisting GLT) and take it from&nbsp;there!

<strong>Update: this script has been largely supplanted by the more flexible <a href="https://github.com/david-davidson/linktagger.py">linktagger.py</a>&mdash;check it out!</strong>
